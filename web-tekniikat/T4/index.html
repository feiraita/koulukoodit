                <p>
                    The Van cat is a distinctive landrace (or "natural breed") of 
                    the domestic cat found around Lake Van in the Eastern Anatolia Region of Trukey.
                    <br>
                    Van cats are relatively large, have a chalky white coat, sometimes with ruddy coloration on the head 
                    and hindquaters, and have blue or amber eyes or have heterochromia (one eye of each color). 
                    <br>
                    The variety has been referred to as "the swimming cat", and has been observed to swim in Lake Van.

                <p>
                    The naturally occuring Van cat type is popularly believed to be the basis of the Turkish Van breed,
                    as standardised and recognised by many cat fancier organizations; it has been internationally selectively bred to
                    consistently produce the ruddy head-and-taill colouring pattern on the white coat.

                   <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Van cats are all-white, or sometimes mostly white and amber marking around the tail and ears. 
                        Locals to the Van area identify only the all-white type as Van cats, according to a 1991 BBC documentary,
                        <i>Cats</i>, written and presented by Roger Tabor.

                    <p>
                        Van cats are known for swimming in Lake Van.
                        This may be the source of the popular, but possibly false or exaggerated,
                        belief that the formal Turkis Van breed is innately more fond of water than the average cat.
